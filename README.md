# A Project to create a UDP based self-stabilizing drone from scratch with Raspberry pi pico W

This was done with Motors, blades, a pre-built body, a battery, a custom motor driver and the raspberry pi pico W

This project involves several subroutines such as:
* Battery management systems
* UDP traffic management systems
* Gyroscopic self-stabilization system - feedback routines
* Flight control systems

Feel free to comment, pull or request for help with similar designs
